## User Experience (UX)

From a personal standpoint, I don't like going to a barber and having to sit in a queue for an hour or more for a haircut.
I created this booking system as an alternative to that paradigm in which I can make a booking that suits my timeline without having to join a queue of customers walking in off the street.

### User Stories
The following user stories are applicable to the creation of the website.
- As a user I want to register an account in order to make bookings
- As an administrator I want to do be able to update information on staff to automatically update the about page which is visible to customers
- As a user I want to do be able to view information about the shop including addresses and telephone numbers
- As an administrator I want to do be able to add and update trading days for customer bookings
- As an administrator I want to do admin functionality to be disabled for standard user to prevent unwanted changes
- As an administrator I want to do add, edit, update and delete services that customers can select
- As a user I want to do have access to see information about the professionals employed in the barber shop to decide who I will book with
- As a user I want to do view a list of past and upcoming bookings
- As a manager I want to do view bookings for all staff to schedule work
- As a staff member I want to do see bookings I have for the current day when logging in to plan my day
- As a customer I want to do update my profile information to keep my details up to date
